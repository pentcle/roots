<h2>Crypto native creative</h2>
<p>Roots is a web3 creative studio combining decades of award winning agency experience on some of the world’s best known brands, with deep crypto knowledge and web3 insider status. </p>
<p>Or, in other words, we’re a crypto native creative node floating  in cyberspace waiting to plug into whatever you’re building.</p>

<h2>Why we started roots</h2>
<p>We met working for one of DeFi’s biggest protocols; overseeing brand, creative, marketing, product innovation, ux, and more. As insiders we worked with external partners and quickly realised that web3 builders cannot rely on web2 agencies. There’s a language barrier, a cultural clash, things get lost in translation.</p> 
<p>So we started roots, to be crypto native creative partners to those building the future of web3.</p>

<h2>Fluent in dev, fluent in normie</h2>
<p>We work with people on all ends of the bell curve, helping the gigabrains building the future communicate and onboard audiences from all walks of life. We believe the next million people to be onboarded to crypto won’t look like the first wave. </p>

<h2>Built to be flexible</h2>
<p>Roots is built to scale up and down depending on project needs. Our core team is nimble enough to dive into small to medium sized projects, with a deep network that can be harnessed to tackle even the biggest project demands.</p>

<h2>We offer</h2>
<ul>
<li>brand strategy</li>
<li>brand architecture</li>
<li>brand design</li>
<li>campaign creative</li>
